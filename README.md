# deep-learning-challenge

For this challenge, I used a dataset called Alphabet Soup that shows organizations that received funding and if the funding was successful or not. 
The challenge was to use machine learning and neural networks to make a model that could be used to predict whether applicants would be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
